Our solution is currently comprised of three projects:

Database - This library assembly contains the implementation of our database. This library also contains the IModel interface and the facade, LocalDB, which implements the interface.

TestApp - This is a console application to test the database via command line input. It allows a user to run the search, enter, and remove commands.

LocalApp - This WPF application connects to a LocalDB. It allows a user to run the search, enter, and remove commands.


To Execute:
	Run TestApp.exe and/or LocalApp.exe.
