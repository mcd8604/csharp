To Execute:
The main function is found within the Program class (Program.cs).  Open the solution in Visual Studio 2008 
and Build/Run.  Input array is retrieved from command line arguments (set in project properties), as specified 
per the assignment specifications.


Design:  We chose to implement the command pattern for this assignment.  We further implemented a simple 
factory to generate command objects.
